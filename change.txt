 Also make the table of posts in the db unless it will not work...

 CREATE TABLE posts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique identifier for each post
    user_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     -- Username of the post creator
    content TEXT NOT NULL               -- Content of the post
);
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique identifier for each user
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- Username, must be unique
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL      -- Password (hashed for security)
);
